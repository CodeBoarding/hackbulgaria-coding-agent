  "description": "The Coding Agent is structured around a clear separation of concerns, facilitating a robust and extensible design. The CLI_Application serves as the primary user interface, handling input/output and orchestrating the agent's lifecycle. At its core, the Agent_Core implements the ReACT pattern, intelligently processing user requests, making decisions, and coordinating actions. It leverages the LLM_Interface to communicate with the underlying Large Language Model and utilizes FileSystem_Tools for interacting with the local file system. All components rely on the Configuration_Manager for centralized access to application settings and sensitive information, ensuring consistent behavior and secure operation. This modular design promotes maintainability and allows for independent evolution of each component.",
