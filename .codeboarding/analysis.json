  "description": "The HackBulgaria Coding Agent operates through a clear, modular architecture designed for interactive problem-solving. The CLI Interface serves as the primary entry point, handling user input and command-line arguments, then initiating the core agent's operations. The AI Agent Core acts as the central orchestrator, employing a ReACT (Reasoning and Acting) pattern to interpret user requests, plan actions, and execute tasks. This core intelligence leverages the LLM Integration Module for all interactions with the Google Gemini Language Model, enabling advanced natural language understanding and generation. Additionally, the File System Tools component provides the agent with essential capabilities to interact with the local file system, allowing it to read, write, and manage project files as required by its tasks. This structured approach ensures a robust and extensible system for automated coding assistance.",
