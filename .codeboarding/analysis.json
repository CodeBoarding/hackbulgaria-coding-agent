  "description": "The `hb-coding-agent` project is structured around a central `Agent Core` that orchestrates interactions between various specialized components. User commands are received via the `User Interface (CLI)`, which then initiates a reasoning and action loop within the `Agent Core`. The `Agent Core` leverages an `LLM Interface` to interact with a Large Language Model for decision-making and content generation. To perform specific tasks, the `Agent Core` utilizes a `Tool Registry/Executor` to access and execute various `Tools`, including a `File System Adapter` for file operations and a `Code Quality Module` for code analysis. `Memory Management` maintains conversational context and state throughout the agent's operation, while a `Configuration Service` provides essential settings to all components. This modular design promotes clear separation of concerns, making the system maintainable and extensible.",
