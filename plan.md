# HackBulgaria Coding Agent - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Building a coding agent using LangChain and Google Gemini with a ReACT (Reasoning and Acting) architecture. The project will follow an iterative, minimal implementation approach.

## Phase 1: Minimal ReACT Coding Agent âœ… COMPLETE

### Goal
Create a basic ReACT agent that can read and write files using Google Gemini as the LLM.

### Core Components

#### 1. Tools (Minimal Set)
- **Read File Tool**: Reads content from a specified file path
  - Input: file path (string)
  - Output: file content (string) with line numbering upfront, or error message
  - Error handling: file not found, permission errors

- **Write File Tool**: Writes content to a specified file path
  - Input: file path (string), new content (string), line range in which the new content will be placed
  - Output: success confirmation or error message
  - Error handling: permission errors, directory creation if needed

#### 2. ReACT Agent
- Use LangChain's ReACT agent implementation
- Integrate Google Gemini via langchain-google-genai
- Agent should be able to:
  - Reason about what actions to take
  - Use the read/write tools appropriately
  - Provide thought process in responses

#### 3. Configuration
- Environment variables for API keys (GOOGLE_API_KEY), use .env for this
- Basic agent configuration (model name, temperature, etc.)

### Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Environment** âœ…
   - Initialize Python 3.12 venv with uv
   - Install dependencies (langchain, langchain-google-genai, pylint, astroid)
   - Configure Git repository

2. **Create Tool Implementations** âœ…
   - Implement read_file tool as LangChain tool
   - Implement write_file tool as LangChain tool
   - Add basic validation and error handling
   - Add home directory support for sandboxing

3. **Initialize Gemini LLM** âœ…
   - Configure Google Gemini model
   - Set up API key management
   - Test basic LLM functionality

4. **Build ReACT Agent** âœ…
   - Create ReACT agent with Gemini + tools (use the default from langchain/langgraph)
   - Configure agent parameters
   - Add prompt engineering for coding tasks

5. **Create Main Interface** âœ…
   - Simple CLI or Python script to interact with agent
   - Accept user prompts
   - Display agent reasoning and actions
   - Format output for better readability

### Success Criteria âœ…
- Agent can successfully read files from the file system âœ…
- Agent can successfully write files to the file system âœ…
- Agent demonstrates ReACT pattern (thought â†’ action â†’ observation) âœ…
- Agent can complete simple coding tasks (e.g., "read config.py and create a summary in summary.txt") âœ…
- Agent supports home directory for sandboxed operations âœ…
- Clean formatted output âœ…

---

## Phase 2: Conversation Memory âœ… COMPLETE

### Goal
Add short-term memory to the agent so it can remember previous messages in the conversation and maintain context across multiple exchanges.

### Problem Statement
Currently, if the agent creates a plan and asks for confirmation, when the user replies "yes", the agent has no memory of what it was asking about. We need conversation history.

### Minimal Implementation

#### 1. Use LangChain's Built-in Memory
- Use `ConversationBufferMemory` from LangChain (simplest option)
- Stores all messages in the current session
- No persistence needed (memory clears when program exits)

#### 2. Integration Points
- Modify `create_coding_agent()` in `react_agent.py`
- Pass memory to the agent via checkpointer
- Use LangGraph's `MemorySaver` for state persistence during session

#### 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Add Memory to Agent** âœ…
   - Import `MemorySaver` from langgraph.checkpoint.memory
   - Create memory checkpointer
   - Pass checkpointer to `create_react_agent()`

2. **Update Main Loop** âœ…
   - Maintain a `thread_id` for the conversation session
   - Pass `thread_id` in config when invoking agent
   - All messages in same session will share memory

3. **Test Memory** âœ…
   - Agent asks question â†’ user confirms â†’ agent remembers context

### Code Changes Required
```python
# In react_agent.py
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

def create_coding_agent(home_directory=None):
    llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(...)
    tools = [read_file_func, write_file_func]
    
    # Add memory
    memory = MemorySaver()
    agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools, checkpointer=memory)
    return agent

# In main.py
thread_id = "default_session"  # Single session for CLI
result = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [("user", user_input)]},
    config={"configurable": {"thread_id": thread_id}}
)
```

### Success Criteria âœ…
- Agent remembers previous messages in the conversation âœ…
- User can confirm/deny without re-explaining context âœ…
- Memory persists throughout CLI session âœ…
- Memory clears when program restarts (expected behavior) âœ…

### Future Enhancements (Post-Phase 2)
- Persistent memory (save to disk/database)
- Summary-based memory (for long conversations)
- Multiple conversation threads
- Memory trimming (keep last N messages)

---

## Phase 3: Pylint Code Validation âœ… COMPLETE

### Goal
Add pylint validation as a tool so the agent can check if the Python code it generates is properly linted and follows best practices.

### Problem Statement
The agent can create and modify Python files, but has no way to validate that the code it generates:
- Has no syntax errors
- Follows Python best practices
- Has no linting issues (unused imports, undefined variables, etc.)

Adding pylint as a tool allows the agent to self-validate its code generation.

### Minimal Implementation

#### 1. Create Pylint Tool
- New tool: `validate_code` or `lint_file`
- Input: file path to Python file
- Output: Linting results (errors, warnings, info)
- Uses pylint's programmatic API (already installed)

#### 2. Tool Capabilities
- Run pylint on a specific Python file
- Return structured output: score, errors, warnings
- Format output to be readable for the LLM
- Allow agent to fix issues based on lint results

#### 3. Integration Points
- Add new tool to `src/tools/` directory
- Register tool with agent in `react_agent.py`
- Agent can use tool as part of its workflow

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create Lint Tool** âœ…
   - Create `src/tools/lint_tools.py`
   - Implement `lint_file` tool using pylint API
   - Parse pylint output into structured format
   - Handle errors gracefully

2. **Integrate with Agent** âœ…
   - Import lint tool in `react_agent.py`
   - Add to tools list
   - Agent now has access to validation

3. **Add System Prompt** âœ…
   - Create comprehensive system prompt
   - Instructs agent to always validate code
   - Defines best practices and workflow

4. **Test Integration** âœ…
   - Agent creates Python file
   - Agent runs lint on file
   - Agent sees issues and can fix them

### Proposed Tool Interface

```python
@tool
def lint_file(file_path: str) -> str:
    """Run pylint on a Python file and return linting results.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to Python file to lint
        
    Returns:
        Formatted linting results with score, errors, and warnings
    """
    # Run pylint
    # Parse results
    # Return formatted output
```

### Expected Output Format
```
Pylint Score: 8.5/10

Errors:
  Line 5: undefined-variable - Undefined variable 'x'
  
Warnings:
  Line 10: unused-import - Unused import 'sys'
  Line 15: line-too-long - Line too long (120/100)

Info:
  No style issues found
```

### Success Criteria âœ…
- Tool can successfully run pylint on Python files âœ…
- Returns clear, actionable feedback âœ…
- Agent can use tool to validate its own code âœ…
- Agent can iterate: create â†’ lint â†’ fix â†’ lint again âœ…
- Works with home directory restrictions âœ…
- System prompt guides agent to use linting automatically âœ…

### Use Case Example
```
You: Create a Python script with a function to calculate factorial
Agent: [Creates file] 
Agent: [Uses lint_file tool to validate]
Agent: "I've created factorial.py with a pylint score of 9.5/10"
```

### Future Enhancements (Post-Phase 3)
- Auto-fix mode using pylint's --fix option
- Configurable pylint rules (.pylintrc)
- Code formatting with black/autopep8
- Type checking with mypy
- Security scanning with bandit

### Future Enhancements (Post-Phase 1)
- Memory and conversation history â†’ Phase 2 âœ…
- Code validation with pylint â†’ Phase 3 âœ…
- Multi-agent system â†’ Phase 4 ðŸ”„
- Additional tools (search, execute code, git operations)
- Multi-file operations
- Code analysis tools (using astroid)
- Improved error handling and recovery
- Structured output and logging

## Phase 4: Multi-Agent System ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

### Goal
Transform the single ReACT agent into a collaborative multi-agent system where specialized agents work together to solve coding tasks. This creates a more robust system with separation of concerns: planning, implementation, and validation.

### Overview
Instead of one agent doing everything, we'll have three specialized agents that communicate and collaborate:

1. **Planning Agent (Readonly)**: Analyzes the problem, explores the codebase, creates execution plan
2. **Implementation Agent (Read/Write)**: Executes the plan, modifies files, uses linting
3. **Validator Agent (Readonly + Git)**: Validates changes using git diff and linting

### Architecture

#### Agent Communication Flow
```
User Request
    â†“
Planning Agent
    â†’ Explores codebase (read files, grep search, bash commands)
    â†’ Analyzes requirements
    â†’ Creates execution plan (structured format)
    â†“
Implementation Agent
    â†’ Receives execution plan
    â†’ Implements changes (create/edit files)
    â†’ Runs linting on changes
    â†’ Reports implementation status
    â†“
Validator Agent
    â†’ Reviews changes (git diff)
    â†’ Validates code quality (linting, AST)
    â†’ Provides approval or requests fixes
    â†“
[If fixes needed: Implementation Agent â†’ Validator Agent loop]
    â†“
Final Result to User
```

### Agent Specifications

#### 1. Planning Agent
**Role**: Understand requirements and create actionable plan

**Tools (Read-only)**:
- `read_file`: Read existing files
- `run_bash_command`: Explore directory structure, search files
- `grep_search`: NEW - Multi-file text search tool

**Responsibilities**:
- Analyze user request
- Explore codebase to understand structure
- Search for relevant files and code patterns
- Create detailed execution plan with:
  - Files to create/modify
  - Changes to make
  - Order of operations
  - Dependencies and considerations

**Output Format**: Structured plan (JSON or Markdown)
```json
{
  "analysis": "Summary of the problem",
  "files_to_modify": ["file1.py", "file2.py"],
  "files_to_create": ["new_file.py"],
  "steps": [
    {"action": "create", "file": "new_file.py", "description": "..."},
    {"action": "modify", "file": "file1.py", "description": "..."}
  ],
  "considerations": ["edge case 1", "dependency on X"]
}
```

#### 2. Implementation Agent

- Any issues encountered
- Status (success/partial/failed)

#### 3. Validator Agent
**Role**: Validate implementation quality and correctness

**Tools (Read-only + Git)**:
- `git_diff`: NEW - Show changes made (git diff)
- `git_status`: NEW - Show file change status
- `lint_file`: Validate code quality
- `read_file`: Review final state of files

**Responsibilities**:
- Review git diff to see all changes
- Validate code quality (linting, AST parsing)
- Check that implementation matches plan
- Provide approval or request specific fixes
- Generate validation report

**Output**: Validation report with:
- Changes summary (from git diff)
- Code quality assessment
- Issues found (if any)
- Approval status (approved/needs-fixes)
- Specific fixes required

### New Tools to Implement

#### 1. grep_search Tool
**Purpose**: Multi-file text search across codebase

```python
@tool
def grep_search(pattern: str, file_pattern: str = "*.py", case_sensitive: bool = False) -> str:
    """Search for text pattern across multiple files.
    
    Args:
        pattern: Text or regex pattern to search for
        file_pattern: File glob pattern (e.g., "*.py", "src/**/*.py")
        case_sensitive: Whether search is case-sensitive
        
    Returns:
        Formatted search results with file paths and line numbers
    """
```

**Use Cases**:
- Find all usages of a function
- Search for TODO comments
- Find import statements
- Locate class definitions

#### 2. git_diff Tool
**Purpose**: Show changes made to files

```python
@tool
def git_diff(file_path: str = "") -> str:
    """Show git diff of changes.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Optional specific file to diff (empty = all changes)
        
    Returns:
        Git diff output showing changes
    """
```

#### 3. git_status Tool
**Purpose**: Show status of working directory

```python
@tool
def git_status() -> str:
    """Show git status of working directory.
    
    Returns:
        List of modified, created, deleted files
    """
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

#### Coordinator/Orchestrator
A simple orchestrator function that:
1. Takes user request
2. Invokes Planning Agent â†’ gets plan
3. Invokes Implementation Agent with plan â†’ gets implementation report
4. Invokes Validator Agent â†’ gets validation report
5. If validation fails: loop (Implementation Agent â†’ Validator Agent)
6. Returns final result to user

**Implementation Approach**: Simple sequential function (not another agent)

```python
def orchestrate_multi_agent(user_request: str, home_directory: str = None):
    """Orchestrate multiple agents to handle a coding request."""
    
    # Phase 1: Planning
    planning_agent = create_planning_agent(home_directory)
    plan = planning_agent.invoke({"messages": [("user", user_request)]})
    
    # Phase 2: Implementation
    implementation_agent = create_implementation_agent(home_directory)
    impl_report = implementation_agent.invoke({
        "messages": [("user", f"Execute this plan:\n{plan}")]
    })
    
    # Phase 3: Validation
    validator_agent = create_validator_agent(home_directory)
    validation = validator_agent.invoke({
        "messages": [("user", f"Validate this implementation:\n{impl_report}")]
    })
    
    # Phase 4: Fix loop (if needed)
    max_iterations = 3
    iteration = 0
    while not is_approved(validation) and iteration < max_iterations:
        fix_request = extract_fixes(validation)
        impl_report = implementation_agent.invoke({
            "messages": [("user", f"Fix these issues:\n{fix_request}")]
        })
        validation = validator_agent.invoke({
            "messages": [("user", f"Re-validate:\n{impl_report}")]
        })
        iteration += 1
    
    return {
        "plan": plan,
        "implementation": impl_report,
        "validation": validation,
        "status": "approved" if is_approved(validation) else "needs_review"
    }
```

```

### Implementation Steps (Minimal)

#### Step 1: Create New Tools
1. **git_tools.py**: Implement git_diff and git_status
   - Use subprocess to run git commands
   - Parse and format output
   - Handle errors (no git repo, no changes, etc.)

2. **search_tools.py**: Implement grep_search
   - Use subprocess to run grep or native Python search
   - Format results with file paths and line numbers
   - Support glob patterns for file filtering

#### Step 2: Create Specialized Agents
1. **planning_agent.py**: 
   - Create agent with readonly tools only
   - System prompt: "You are a planning agent..."
   - Tools: read_file, run_bash_command, grep_search

2. **implementation_agent.py**:
   - Create agent with read/write tools
   - System prompt: "You are an implementation agent..."
   - Tools: read_file, write_file, lint_file, run_bash_command

3. **validator_agent.py**:
   - Create agent with validation tools
   - System prompt: "You are a validator agent..."
   - Tools: git_diff, git_status, lint_file, read_file

#### Step 3: Create Orchestrator
1. **orchestrator.py**:
   - Simple function-based orchestration (not agent-based)
   - Sequential execution: Planning â†’ Implementation â†’ Validation
   - Simple fix loop with max iterations
   - Structured output format

#### Step 4: Update Main CLI
1. **main.py**:
   - Add flag for multi-agent mode: `--multi-agent`
   - When enabled, use orchestrator instead of single agent
   - Display progress for each phase
   - Show intermediate results (plan, implementation, validation)

### System Prompts

#### Planning Agent Prompt
```
You are an expert planning agent. Your role is to analyze coding requests and create detailed execution plans.

You have READ-ONLY access to the codebase. Use your tools to:
- Explore directory structure
- Read existing files
- Search for patterns across files
- Understand current code organization

Your output should be a structured plan with:
1. Analysis: Summary of the problem
2. Files to create: List with descriptions
3. Files to modify: List with descriptions
4. Step-by-step actions: Ordered list of what to do
5. Considerations: Edge cases, dependencies, risks

Be thorough and specific. The implementation agent will follow your plan exactly.
```

#### Implementation Agent Prompt
```
You are an expert implementation agent. Your role is to execute coding plans.

You will receive a plan from the planning agent. Follow it step by step:
1. Create or modify files as specified
2. After each Python file change, run lint_file
3. Fix any linting issues immediately
4. Report progress and results

Be precise and careful. Aim for clean, well-tested code with pylint scores of 8.0+.
```

#### Validator Agent Prompt
```
You are an expert validation agent. Your role is to review and validate code changes.

Use your tools to:
1. Check git diff to see all changes
2. Validate code quality with linting
3. Verify implementation matches the plan
4. Check for edge cases and issues

Provide a validation report with:
- Summary of changes
- Code quality assessment
- Issues found (be specific)
- Approval status (approved/needs-fixes)
- If fixes needed: specific instructions

Be thorough but fair. Focus on correctness and quality.
```

### Communication Format

Agents communicate via **structured messages** in their shared memory/context:

```python
# Planning Agent Output
{
    "type": "plan",
    "analysis": "User wants to create a REST API endpoint...",
    "files_to_create": [
        {"path": "api/users.py", "purpose": "User endpoint handlers"}
    ],
    "files_to_modify": [
        {"path": "api/__init__.py", "purpose": "Register new routes"}
    ],
    "steps": [
        {"seq": 1, "action": "create", "file": "api/users.py", "details": "..."},
        {"seq": 2, "action": "modify", "file": "api/__init__.py", "details": "..."}
    ]
}

# Implementation Agent Output
{
    "type": "implementation_report",
    "status": "success",
    "files_created": ["api/users.py"],
    "files_modified": ["api/__init__.py"],
    "linting_results": {
        "api/users.py": {"score": 9.5, "issues": []},
        "api/__init__.py": {"score": 10.0, "issues": []}
    }
}

# Validator Agent Output
{
    "type": "validation_report",
    "status": "approved",  # or "needs_fixes"
    "changes_summary": "Created users.py with GET/POST handlers...",
    "quality_score": 9.5,
    "issues": [],
    "approval": true,
    "fix_instructions": []  # populated if approval is false
}
```

### Minimal Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Create `src/tools/git_tools.py` with git_diff and git_status
- [ ] Create `src/tools/search_tools.py` with grep_search
- [ ] Create `src/agent/planning_agent.py` with readonly tools
- [ ] Create `src/agent/implementation_agent.py` with read/write tools
- [ ] Create `src/agent/validator_agent.py` with validation tools
- [ ] Create `src/agent/orchestrator.py` with sequential coordination
- [ ] Update `src/main.py` to support `--multi-agent` flag
- [ ] Test with simple task: "Create a hello world function"
- [ ] Test with complex task: "Add REST endpoint for users"

### Success Criteria

âœ… **Planning Agent**:
- Can explore codebase with readonly tools
- Produces structured, actionable plans
- Uses grep_search to find relevant code

âœ… **Implementation Agent**:
- Follows plans from planning agent
- Creates/modifies files correctly
- Runs linting automatically
- Fixes issues iteratively

âœ… **Validator Agent**:
- Reviews changes with git diff
- Validates code quality
- Provides clear feedback
- Approves or requests specific fixes

âœ… **Orchestration**:
- Sequential flow works: Planning â†’ Implementation â†’ Validation
- Fix loop works: Implementation â†” Validator (max 3 iterations)
- User sees progress for each phase
- Final result includes all phase outputs

âœ… **End-to-End**:
- User gives request â†’ system produces validated implementation
- Changes are committed to git (or ready to commit)
- All Python files pass linting
- System provides comprehensive report

### Example Usage

```bash
# Single agent mode (existing)
python src/main.py --home ./test-project
You: Create a factorial function

# Multi-agent mode (new)
python src/main.py --home ./test-project --multi-agent
You: Create a factorial function

# Output:
# [PLANNING] Analyzing request...
# [PLANNING] Creating execution plan...
# Plan: Create factorial.py with factorial function and tests
# 
# [IMPLEMENTATION] Executing plan...
# [IMPLEMENTATION] Created factorial.py
# [IMPLEMENTATION] Linting: 9.5/10
# 
# [VALIDATION] Reviewing changes...
# [VALIDATION] Git diff: +25 lines in factorial.py
# [VALIDATION] Code quality: Excellent
# [VALIDATION] âœ… APPROVED
#
# Final Result: Successfully created factorial function with validation
```

### Technical Considerations

1. **Agent Independence**: Each agent is an independent ReACT agent with its own tools and prompt
2. **No Shared State**: Agents communicate via messages/outputs, not shared memory
3. **Sequential Execution**: Simple coordinator function, not parallel (easier to implement)
4. **Error Handling**: Each agent can fail independently; orchestrator handles failures
5. **Iteration Limit**: Max 3 fix iterations to prevent infinite loops
6. **Git Requirements**: Assumes working directory is a git repo (or initialize one)

### Future Enhancements (Post-Phase 4)

- Parallel agent execution where possible
- Human-in-the-loop approval points
- More sophisticated agent communication (message bus)
- Agent specialization (testing agent, documentation agent)
- Learning from validation feedback
- Cost tracking per agent
- Agent performance metrics
